  **Priority on Workstation Arrival:**

  **1. Check IOS (leftover items)**
     - If IOS has item AND EOS has space:
       Start Store step immediately
     - If IOS has item AND EOS full:
       Release worker (blocked)

  **2. Check IIS (ready to process?)**
     - If Producer OR all IIS filled:
       Start Process step
       Game runs work timer
       Game sends work_completed when done
     - If IIS needs items:
       Start Pickup step (move to EIS)
     - If no EIS items available:
       Release worker (blocked)
